    <h3 class="heading">The Flash</h3>
    <img src="images/flash-2.png" alt="">
    <p class="flash">The Flash (or simply Flash) is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books
        published by DC Comics. Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, the original Flash first
        appeared in Flash Comics #1 (cover date January 1940/release month November 1939).[1] Nicknamed "the Scarlet
        Speedster", all incarnations of the Flash possess "superspeed", which includes the ability to run, move, and
        think extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes, and seemingly violate certain laws of physics.

        Thus far, at least five different characters—each of whom somehow gained the power of "the Speed Force"—have
        assumed the mantle of the Flash in DC's history: college athlete Jay Garrick (1940–1951, 1961–2011,
        2017–present), forensic scientist Barry Allen (1956–1985, 2008–present), Barry's nephew Wally West (1986–2011,
        2016–present), Barry's grandson Bart Allen (2006–2007), and Chinese-American Avery Ho (2017–present). Each
        incarnation of the Flash has been a key member of at least one of DC's premier teams: the Justice Society of
        America, the Justice League, and the Teen Titans.

        The Flash is one of DC Comics' most popular characters and has been integral to the publisher's many
        reality-changing "crisis" story lines over the years. The original meeting of the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick
        and Silver Age Flash Barry Allen in "Flash of Two Worlds" (1961) introduced the Multiverse storytelling concept
        to DC readers, which would become the basis for many DC stories in the years to come.

        Like his Justice League colleagues Wonder Woman, Superman and Batman, the Flash has a distinctive cast of
        adversaries, including Gorilla Grodd, the various Rogues (unique among DC supervillains for their code of honor)
        and the various psychopathic "speedsters" who go by the names Reverse-Flash or Zoom. Other supporting characters
        in Flash stories include Barry's wife Iris West, Wally's wife Linda Park, Bart's girlfriend Valerie Perez,
        friendly fellow speedster Max Mercury, and Central City police department members David Singh and Patty Spivot.

        A staple of the comic book DC Universe, the Flash has been adapted to numerous DC films, video games, animated
        series, and live-action television shows. In live-action, Barry Allen has been portrayed by Rod Haase for the
        1979 television special Legends of the Superheroes, John Wesley Shipp in the 1990 The Flash series and Grant
        Gustin in the 2014 The Flash series, and by Ezra Miller in the DC Extended Universe series of films, beginning
        with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Shipp also portrays a version of Jay Garrick in the 2014 The
        Flash series. The various incarnations of the Flash also feature in animated series such as Superman: The
        Animated Series, Justice League, Batman: The Brave and the Bold and Young Justice, as well as the DC Universe
        Animated Original Movies series.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">Barry Allen</h3>
    <img class="F" src="images/Flash-1.png">
    <p class="flash">Barry Allen is an assistant scientist from the Criminal and Forensic Science Division of Central
        City Police Department. Barry had a reputation for being very slow, deliberate, and frequently late, which
        frustrated his fiancée, Iris West. One night, as he was preparing to leave work, a freak lightning bolt struck a
        nearby shelf in his lab and doused him with a cocktail of unnamed chemicals. As a result, Barry found that he
        could run extremely fast and had matching reflexes. He donned a set of red tights sporting a lightning bolt
        (reminiscent of the original Fawcett Comics Captain Marvel), dubbed himself the Flash (after his childhood hero,
        Jay Garrick), and became a crimefighter active in Central City. In his civilian identity, he stores the costume
        compressed in a special ring via the use of a special gas that could compress cloth fibers to a very small
        fraction of their normal size.

        Barry sacrificed his life for the universe in the 1985 maxi-series Crisis on Infinite Earths and remained dead
        for over twenty years after that story's publication. With the 2008 series Final Crisis, Barry returned to the
        DC Universe and returned to full prominence as the Flash in the 2009 series The Flash: Rebirth, which was soon
        after followed by a new volume of The Flash ongoing series, where Barry's adventures as the Scarlet Speedster
        were published until 2020.</p>
