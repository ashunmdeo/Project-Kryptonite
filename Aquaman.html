    <h3 class="heading">Aquaman</h3>
    <p class="about-aquaman">Aquaman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by
        Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941). Initially a
        backup feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series.
        During the late 1950s and 1960s superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding member of
        the Justice League. In the 1990s Modern Age, writers interpreted Aquaman's character more seriously, with
        storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis.

        The son of a human lighthouse-keeper and the queen of Atlantis, Aquaman is the alias of Arthur Curry, who also
        goes by the Atlantean name Orin. Others to use the title of Aquaman include a short-lived human successor,
        Joseph Curry; his protégé Jackson Hyde; and the mysterious Adam Waterman, who was briefly active during World
        War II. Aquaman's comic books are filled with colourful undersea characters and a rich supporting cast,
        including his mentor Vulko, his powerful wife Mera, and various sidekicks such as Aqualad, Aquagirl, and
        Dolphin. Aquaman stories tend to blend high fantasy and science fiction. His villains include his archenemy
        Black Manta and his own half-brother Ocean Master, among others.

        The character's original 1960s animated appearances left a lasting impression, making Aquaman widely recognized
        in popular culture and one of the world's most recognized superheroes. Jokes about his wholesome, weak portrayal
        in Super Friends and perceived feeble powers and abilities have been staples of comedy programs and stand-up
        routines, leading DC at several times to attempt to make the character edgier or more powerful in the
        comic books. Modern comic book depictions have attempted to reconcile these various aspects of his public
        perception, with many versions often casting Aquaman as serious and brooding, weighed down by his public
        reputation, his responsibilities as king, and the complex world of Atlantean politics.

        Aquaman has been featured in several adaptations, first appearing in animated form in the 1967 The
        Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and then in the related Super Friends program. Since then he has appeared in
        various animated productions, including prominent roles in the 2000s series Justice League and Justice League
        Unlimited and Batman: The Brave and the Bold, as well as several DC Universe Animated Original Movies. Actor
        Alan Ritchson also portrayed the character in the live action television show Smallville. In the DC Extended
        Universe, actor Jason Momoa portrays the character in the films Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Justice
        League and its director's cut Zack Snyder's Justice League, Aquaman, the HBO Max series Peacemaker, and the
        upcoming Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.

    <h3 class="heading">Mera</h3>
    <p class="about-mera">Mera is a fictional superheroine and warrior appearing in American comic books
        published by DC Comics. Created by Jack Miller and Nick Cardy, the character first appeared in Aquaman #11
        (September 1963).

        Originally portrayed as a supporting character to her husband, the superhero Aquaman, possessing the formidable
        hydrokinetic power to create and control water, modern writers have given greater emphasis to her superhuman
        physical strength. Mera has been depicted as a member of DC Comics' flagship superhero team, the Justice League.
        Queen Mera's earlier storylines have also portrayed her mental breakdown, as she was faced with crippling loss.
        The stories explored her attempts at coping with lasting anger and rage. More recent storylines have explored
        her approach to rulership in comparison to her husband.

        The character has been adapted substantially in various media, she was played by Elena Satine on Smallville and
        most notably featured in the DC Extended Universe where Amber Heard portrayed Mera in Justice League and its
        director's cut, reprised the role in Aquaman and will return in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. The
        character has also been adapted in the animated Young Justice television series.</p>
