    <h3 class="heading-1">Superman & Lois</h3>
    <p class="about-superman">Superman and Lois Lane are a fictional couple and the first superhero comic book romance.
        Created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, both characters including Superman's alter ego, Clark
        Kent, first appeared in DC Comics' Action Comics #1 (June 1938). They have remained in a complicated
        relationship ever since. A supercouple, they are among the best known fictional couples and have appeared in
        multiple media adaptations.

        The characters' relationship was based for a long time in a love triangle in which Clark was interested in Lois
        who was smitten with the superhero Superman. Clark, unable to reveal to Lois that his mild-mannered demeanor was
        a ruse, was unable to compete for Lois' affection. The irony being he was his own rival in that Clark and
        Superman are, in fact, the same person. This love triangle and the dual identity were originally conceived in
        1934. Following John Byrne's 1986 reboot, The Man of Steel, Clark's character became not only the more dominant
        personality of the Clark Kent/Superman character and more outgoing, aggressive, and assertive. This allowed a
        more natural romance to develop between Lois and Clark.

        In the 1990s, Clark proposed marriage to Lois and revealed his identity as Superman to her. They began a
        long engagement, which was complicated by the death of Superman, a breakup, and several other problems. The
        couple married in Superman: The Wedding Album (December 1996). Clark and Lois' biological child in DC Comics
        canon was born in Convergence: Superman #2 (July 2015), a son named Jon Kent, who becomes Superboy.

        Lois is the character most prominently featured with Superman, she appears in virtually every Superman comics
        and media adaptations and continues to be an essential part of the Superman mythos. Across decades of comics and
        other media adaptations, in some stories, Lois knows or suspects that Clark is Superman, sometimes this is
        explored for humour or plot development.</p>
