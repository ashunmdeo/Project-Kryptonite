    <p class="about-batman">Batman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The
        character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book
        Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy
        American playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features
        him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha as a
        child, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a
        bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied
        Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred Pennyworth, James
        Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker.

        Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although Kane frequently
        claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something
        more bat-like. The character received his own spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Batman was originally
        introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a character with
        a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any
        superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series
        used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended.
        Various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the
        1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">Creation</h3>
    <p class="about-batman"> In early 1939, the success of Superman in Action Comics prompted editors at National Comics
        Publications (the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles. In response, Bob Kane created
        "the Bat-Man". Collaborator Bill Finger recalled that "Kane had an idea for a character called 'Batman,' and
        he'd like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like
        Superman with kind of ...reddish tights, I believe, with boots ...no gloves, no gauntlets ...with a small domino
        mask, swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it
        was a big sign ...BATMAN". The bat-wing-like cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired as a child by Leonardo
        da Vinci's sketch of an ornithopter flying device.

        Finger suggested giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and
        gloves; he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume. Finger said he
        devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity: "Bruce Wayne's first name came from Robert the
        Bruce, the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would
        suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ...then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne." He later said his
        suggestions were influenced by Lee Falk's popular The Phantom, a syndicated newspaper comic-strip character with
        which Kane was also familiar.</p>
