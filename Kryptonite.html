    <h3 class="heading-1">About Superman</h3>
    <img id="superman-img" src="./images/about superman2.png" alt="">
    <p class="about-superman">Superman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The
        character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and debuted in the comic book Action Comics
        #1 (cover-dated June 1938 and published April 18, 1938). Superman has been adapted to a number of other
        media, including radio serials, novels, films, television shows, theater productions, and video games.

        Superman was born on the fictional planet Krypton and was named Kal-El. When he was a baby, his parents sent him
        to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in
        the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan
        and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible
        strength and impervious skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of humanity,
        and he decided to fight crime. To protect his personal life, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the
        alias "Superman" when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where he works
        as a journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include his love interest and fellow
        journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen and editor-in-chief Perry White, and enemies such as
        Brainiac, General Zod, and his archenemy Lex Luthor.

        Superman is the archetype of the superhero: he wears an outlandish costume, uses a codename, and fights evil
        with the aid of extraordinary abilities. Although there are earlier characters who arguably fit this definition,
        it was Superman who popularized the superhero genre and established its conventions. He was the best-selling
        superhero in American comic books until the 1980s.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-1">Creation & Conception</h3>
    <p class="about-superman">Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster met in 1932 while attending Glenville High School in
        Cleveland and bonded over their admiration of fiction. Siegel aspired to become a writer and Shuster aspired to
        become an illustrator. Siegel wrote amateur science fiction stories, which he self-published as a magazine
        called Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization. His friend Shuster often provided
        illustrations for his work. In January 1933, Siegel published a short story in his magazine titled "The Reign
        of the Superman". The titular character is a homeless man named Bill Dunn who is tricked by an evil scientist
        into consuming an experimental drug. The drug gives Dunn the powers of mind-reading, mind-control, and
        clairvoyance. He uses these powers maliciously for profit and amusement, but then the drug wears off, leaving
        him a powerless vagrant again. Shuster provided illustrations, depicting Dunn as a bald man.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-1">Krypton</h3>
    <p class="about-superman">Krypton is a fictional planet appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics,
        most commonly appearing or mentioning in stories starring the superhero Superman as the world he came from. The
        planet was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, and was named after the chemical element krypton. The planet
        was first mentioned in Action Comics #1 (June 1938) and made its first appearance in Superman #1 (1939).

        Krypton is also the native world of Supergirl, Krypto the Superdog, Beppo the Super-Monkey, Power Girl (in her
        case, an alternate-universe version designated "Krypton-Two"), and the supervillain General Zod. It has been
        consistently described as having been destroyed shortly after Superman's escape from the planet, although the
        exact details of its destruction vary by time period and writers. Kryptonians were the dominant species on
        Krypton.

        Krypton also makes an appearance in several television series such as Adventures of Superman, Lois & Clark: The
        New Adventures of Superman, Superman: The Animated Series, Smallville, Supergirl, and Krypton. Krypton appears
        in the 1978 film Superman, the 2006 film Superman Returns, and the 2013 film Man of Steel, set in the DC
        Extended Universe.</p>

    <!-- <h3 class="heading-2">Kryptonite</h3>
    <p class="about-superman1">Kryptonite is a fictional material that appears primarily in Superman stories published by
        DC Comics. In its best-known form, it is a green, crystalline material originating from Superman's home world of
        Krypton that emits a unique, poisonous radiation that can weaken and even kill Kryptonians. Kryptonite radiation
        can emit through any element except lead. Thus, Superman has a special lead suit to protect himself from the
        radiation. There are other varieties of kryptonite, such as red and gold kryptonite, which have different but
        still generally negative effects. Due to Superman's popularity, kryptonite has become a byword for an
        extraordinary exploitable weakness, synonymous with "Achilles' heel". Batman, Lex Luthor, Metallo, and Titano
        are four notable characters often presented as using kryptonite â€” the first carrying the substance as a
        last-ditch method to stop his ally Superman if he is subject to mind control or otherwise compromised, the next
        two using the mineral to ward off Superman or incorporating it into weapons, and the fourth being able to
        project rays of kryptonite radiation from his eyes after being altered by simultaneous exposure to kryptonite
        and uranium.</p>
