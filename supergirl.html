    <h3 class="heading">Supergirl</h3>
    <p class="supergirl">Supergirl is the name of several fictional superheroines appearing in American comic books
        published by DC Comics. The original, current, and most well known Supergirl is Kara Zor-El, the cousin of
        superhero Superman. The character made her first appearance in Action Comics #252 (May 1959) and was created by
        Otto Binder and Al Plastino.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-2">Concept</h3>
    <img src="images/supergirl-3.png" atl="">
    <p class="supergirl">Created as a female counterpart to Superman, Kara Zor-El shares his superpowers and
        vulnerability to Kryptonite. Supergirl plays a supporting role in various DC Comics publications, including
        Action Comics, Superman, and several comic book series unrelated to Superman. In 1969, Supergirl's adventures
        became the lead feature in Adventure Comics, and she later starred in an eponymous comic book series which
        debuted in 1972 and ran until 1974, followed by a second monthly comic book series, The Daring New Adventures of
        Supergirl, which ran from 1982 to 1984. Supergirl was originally introduced in Action Comics #252 as the cousin
        of the publisher's flagship superhero, Superman in the story The Supergirl from Krypton. In most depictions, she
        is an alien from the planet Krypton, possessing a multitude of superhuman abilities derived from the rays of a
        yellow sun. Other mainstream characters have taken the name Supergirl over the years, with decidedly
        non-extraterrestrial origins, such as that of a superhuman artificial life-form. The 2016 miniseries Supergirl:
        Being Super written by Mariko Tamaki and pencilled by Joelle Jones is a coming-of-age take on Supergirl's
        origins.[1] It depicts Kara as a seemingly ordinary teenager living in the rural Midvale with the Danvers, since
        the couple found her inside a pod in the middle of a field. Kara grows up aware of the pod and her unknown
        origins (which are glimpsed in dreams) and struggles to live a normal life as she discovers her astonishing
        super-human abilities, which she keeps a secret even from her closest friends.

        Because of changing editorial policy at DC, Supergirl was initially killed off in the year 1985 limited series
        Crisis on Infinite Earths. DC Comics subsequently rebooted the continuity of the DC Comics Universe,
        re-establishing Superman's character as the sole survivor of Krypton's destruction. Following the conclusion of
        Crisis on Infinite Earths, several different characters written as having no familial relationship to Superman
        have assumed the role of Supergirl, including Matrix, Linda Danvers, and Cir-El. Following the cancellation of
        the third Supergirl comic book series (1996–2003), which starred the Matrix/Linda Danvers version of the
        character, a modern version of Kara Zor-El was reintroduced into the DC Comics continuity in "The Supergirl from
        Krypton" story within Superman/Batman #8 (February 2004). This modern Kara Zor-El stars as Supergirl in an
        eponymous comic book series and additionally in a supporting role in various other DC Comics publications.

        Since her initial comic book appearances, the character later branched out into animation, film, television, and
        merchandising. In May 2011, Supergirl placed 94th on IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time.
        In November 2013, the character placed 17th on IGN's list of the Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">Krypton Returns</h3>
    <p class="supergirl">Kara helped Superman and Superboy to ruin Hel's plans to bring Krypton back to life, an act
        which would alter
        the time line and destroy the universe.

        Supergirl traveled to the Battle of the Sky Core during the Great War in order to prevent a clone insurrection
        and defeated H'el in that timeline. For his part, Superboy was sent to Argo City, a few days before Krypton's
        destruction, and protected Kara Zor-El from H'El.

        Kara and Kal reunited in the present after fulfilling their respective missions. There, they learned Superboy
        didn't make it. Mourning his loss, they returned to Earth.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-3">Red Daughter of Krypton</h3>
    <img class="supergirl2" src="images/supergirl-6.png" alt="">
    <p class="supergirl">After several months of endless battles during which Kara never dealt with her survivor guilt
        and feelings of loss and loneliness, and believing she had been manipulated, betrayed or let down by everybody
        she met, Kara was on the verge of a breakdown.

        While visiting Dr. Veritas, The Block was attacked by Lobo.[41]. Kara initially tried to talk him down, but he
        exploited her friendliness to hurt her. Feeling angrier than ever, Supergirl decided she was done with being
        civil. They fought, and Lobo taunted Kara during the whole battle until she exploded, and her long-repressed,
        unleashed fury acted like a magnet to a Red Power Ring.

        After a brief scuffle with Silver Banshee, a barely coherent and enraged Kara flew into space so that she didn't
        hurt anybody. Found by a pair of Green Lanterns, Kara was taken to Ysmault by Hal Jordan and dunked into the
        Blood Ocean. After getting her sanity back, Kara joined the Red Lantern Corps of Guy Gardner

        Ironically, joining the Rage Lanterns helped Kara get over her anger and isolation issues, and gain emotional
        stability. She fought alongside the Red Lanterns for a while, battling the Diasporans and Atrocitus' splinter
        cell However Guy kicked her out of the team, unwilling to let her get killed by Atrocitus.with her Red Lantern
        tenure over, Kara decided to come back to Earth. She was reentering Solar System when she was attacked by the
        Diasporan army. Although the Diasporans tried their best to capture her, Kara beat them and engaged the
        Diasporan leader, who revealed he was the last Worldkiller. A parasitic being, the Worldkiller tried to bond
        with Kara and take over her body. Kara hurled herself into the Sun to destroy it, but when her attempt failed,
        she removed her Red Ring. Such action should have killed her, but the Sun restarted her heart and granted her a
        power boost which allowed her to destroy the last Worldkiller once and for all.

        Free from the Red Ring and the accompanying all-consuming anger and confusion clouding her mind, Kara realized
        Earth could become her new home after all, and headed for the planet.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">Supergirl and the Justice League</h3>
    <p class="supergirl">After being released from the Red Ring, Supergirl listened to a distant cry for help across the
        galaxy. Kara streaked through the space to help several Leaguers solve a case. Kara joined the new Justice
        League along with Martian Manhunter, Stargirl, Green Arrow, Animal Man, Hawkman, Equinox, Adam Strange and
        Alanna Strange to deal with Infinitus and other threats.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">Crisis on Infinite Earths</h3>
    <div class="supergirl">"Crisis on Infinite Earths" is a 1985 American comic book crossover storyline published by
        DC
        Comics. The series, written by Marv Wolfman and pencilled by George Pérez, was first serialized as a 12-issue
        limited series from April 1985 to March 1986. As the main piece of a crossover event, some plot elements were
        featured in tie-in issues of other publications. Since its initial publication, the series has been reprinted in
        various formats and editions.

        The idea for the series stemmed from Wolfman's desire to abandon the DC Multiverse depicted in the company's
        comics—which he thought was unfriendly to readers—and create a single, unified DC Universe (DCU). The foundation
        of Crisis on Infinite Earths developed through a character (the Monitor) introduced in Wolfman's The New Teen
        Titans in July 1982 before the series itself started.

        At the start of Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Anti-Monitor (the Monitor's evil counterpart) is unleashed on the
        DC Multiverse and begins to destroy the various Earths that it comprises. The Monitor tries to recruit heroes
        from around the Multiverse but is murdered, while Brainiac collaborates with the villains to conquer the
        remaining Earths. However, both the heroes and villains are eventually united by the Spectre; the series
        concludes with Kal-L, Superboy-Prime and Alexander Luthor Jr. defeating the Anti-Monitor and the creation of a
        single Earth in place of the Multiverse. Crisis on Infinite Earths is noted for its high death count; hundreds
        of characters died, including DC icons Kara Zor-El (the original Supergirl) and Barry Allen (the Flash of the
        Silver Age). The story's events resulted in the entire DCU being rebooted, dividing the fictional universe's
        timeline into "pre-Crisis" and "post-Crisis" eras.</div>
    <h3 class="heading-4">Supergirl Death</h3>
    <img class="supergirl-3" src="images/supergirl-2.png">
    <p class="supergirl">The death of Supergirl in the original Crisis on Infinite Earths comics was as ground-breaking
        as it was heart-breaking, marking one of the then rare occasions where a major superhero was permanently killed
        off. Given that, fans of the Arrowverse are wondering how closely the crossover event of the same name will
        follow the original comics, and if Supergirl's Kara Zor-El's days are numbered.
        The death of Supergirl occurred in Crisis on Infinite Earths #7. It was here that the mightiest heroes of the
        five remaining positive-matter universes and Lady Quark (the sole-survivor of Earth-6) were led into the
        anti-matter universe by Pariah to launch a direct attack on the Anti-Monitor in his fortress. The battle did not
        go smoothly, as the physical laws of the anti-matter universe were radically different, and those heroes with
        the ability to alter matter and energy, like Captain Atom and Firestorm, found that their powers were
        unreliable. Even the Superman and Supergirl of Earth-1 were not immune to this effect, with some element of the
        anti-matter universe weakening their natural invulnerability.
        Despite this, Superman fought his way to the center of the Anti-Monitor's fortress, only to be ambushed by the
        Anti-Monitor as he reached the giant solar-collector that threatened to destroy the remaining Earths. Supergirl
        heard Superman's pained screams and broke off from the main battle to charge to the rescue of her "baby cousin."
        Enraged, the Girl of Steel destroyed the solar collector and cracked the Anti-Monitor's armor, sending him
        running. The Anti-Monitor had his revenge, however, shooting one final blast of anti-matter into Supergirl's
        back and fatally wounding her, as he made his escape.
        Nothing like this happened in the first three chapters of the Arrowverse crossover event Crisis on Infinite
        Earths, though Kara Zor-El has been a major part of each episode. Crisis "Part 1" largely centered on Supergirl
        and her efforts to evacuate her Earth before it was destroyed by the Anti-Monitor. Crisis "Part 2" saw Supergirl
        learning that she was one of 7 Paragons — heroes whose survival was key to saving the multiverse — and
        partnering with Batwoman to seek out the Paragon of Courage. Crisis "Part 3" saw Kara contemplating her status
        as the Paragon of Hope and how it might be her role to use a cosmic artifact called the Book of Destiny to
        restore the universes destroyed by the Anti-Monitor.
        Despite what happened in the comics and Kara's willingness to die to save reality, it seems unlikely that
        Supergirl will be sacrificing herself to save the Arrowverse. Fans of the empowered female hero can sigh with
        relief. With the Book of Destiny having been destroyed and the Paragons taking refugee in a place outside of
        Space and Time that the Anti-Monitor cannot reach, Kara cannot enact her plan to sacrifice herself to allow the
        multiverse to be reborn. Besides, with Lex Luthor having replaced the Superman of Earth-96 among the Paragons
        after rewriting part of the Book of Destiny, Kara isn't about to go quietly into the night unless she can be
        guaranteed that Luthor is going with her.
