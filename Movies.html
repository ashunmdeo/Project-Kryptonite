    <!-- <p class="about-superman">Man of Steel is a 2013 superhero film based on the DC Comics character Superman.
            Directed by
            Zack
            Snyder, the story was developed by David S. Goyer and producer Christopher Nolan, with Goyer writing the
            screenplay. The film serves as a reboot of the Superman film series, depicting the character's origin
            story, and
            it is the first installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). Man of Steel stars Henry Cavill in the
            title role along with Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, and
            Russell
            Crowe. In the film, Clark Kent learns that he is a superpowered alien from the planet Krypton. He
            assumes the
            role of mankind's protector as Superman, making the choice to face General Zod and prevent him from
            destroying
            humanity.

            Development began in 2008 when Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters, and
            directors,
            opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling resulted in Jerry Siegel's family recapturing
            the rights
            to Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the
            families
            additional royalties from previous films, but if they did not begin production on a Superman film by
            2011, then
            the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Nolan
            pitched
            Goyer's idea after a story discussion on The Dark Knight Rises, and Snyder was hired as the film's
            director in
            October 2010. Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago, Illinois, before moving to
            Vancouver
            and Plano, Illinois.
            The planet Krypton is destabilized from the mining of the planetary core. Just before the planet explodes,
            Krypton's supreme council chief advisor Jor-El infuses the genetics codex into his infant son, Kal-El, the
            first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries. Jor-El manages to send Kal-El in a spacecraft toward
            Earth before being killed by General Zod during an uprising. Kal-El lands in Kansas, where he is adopted by
            Jonathan and Martha Kent and named Clark. As he grows older, he develops superhuman powers that Jonathan
            urges him to keep hidden, even refusing Clark's help years later during a tornado incident where he loses
            his life. Burdened with guilt over Jonathan's death, Clark travels the globe hiding under various aliases
            seeking a purpose in life.

            Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane receives an assignment to investigate the discovery of a Kryptonian scout
            ship in the Canadian Arctic. Clark enters the ship disguised as a worker and learns from its artificial
            intelligence (AI), modeled after his father Jor-El, that Clark was sent to Earth to guide its people. While
            following Clark, Lois inadvertently triggers the ship's security system, and he uses his powers to rescue
            Lois from its defenses. He wears a uniform provided by the ship's AI and begins testing his flying
            abilities. Unable to convince supervisor Perry White to publish an article on the incident, Lois tracks down
            Clark in Smallville, with the intent of exposing him. However, Lois drops the story upon hearing of Jonathan
            Kent's sacrifice, keeping Clark's identity safe, which fuels Perry's suspicions.

            Zod and his crew escape the Phantom Zone, where they were imprisoned for treason for their actions against
            Krypton. They travel to Earth to turn it into a new Krypton, possessing several terraforming devices
            salvaged from Kryptonian outposts. Following Clark and Lois' capture, Zod's science officer, Jax-Ur,
            extracts Clark's genes to create Kryptonian colonists who will build a society based on Zod's ideals of
            genetic purity. Using the Jor-El AI to take over the ship, Clark and Lois flee and warn the U.S. military of
            Zod's plan, resulting in an explosive confrontation between Clark and Zod's troops.</p>
